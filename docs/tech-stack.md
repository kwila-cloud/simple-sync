# simple-sync Technology Stack

This document outlines the technology stack chosen for the `simple-sync` project, along with the pros and cons of each choice. The primary goals are simple code, above-average performance, and very high maintainability.

## 1. Language: Go

*   **Choice:** Go (Golang)
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Clean syntax, easy to learn, avoids complexities of other languages.
    *   **Performance:** Compiled language, efficient memory management, excellent concurrency.
    *   **Maintainability:** Strong typing, built-in testing framework, excellent tooling (gofmt, golint), comprehensive standard library.
    *   **Concurrency:** Built-in concurrency features (goroutines, channels) for efficient handling of multiple clients.
    *   **Deployment:** Compiles to a single, self-contained binary for easy deployment.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Error Handling:** Go's explicit error handling can be verbose.
    *   **Generics (Before Go 1.18):** Lack of generics (resolved in Go 1.18) could lead to some code duplication in certain scenarios.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   *Python:*
        *   Pros: Simplicity, rapid prototyping.
        *   Cons: Generally lower performance than Go, potential maintainability challenges in larger projects.
    *   *Node.js:*
        *   Pros: Good performance and scalability.
        *   Cons: Asynchronous, callback-based programming model can lead to complex code.
    *   *Java:*
        *   Pros: Robust and performant.
        *   Cons: Verbose and complex, potentially hindering simplicity and maintainability.

## 2. Web Framework: Gin (or Standard Library)

*   **Choice:** Gin (or Standard Library `net/http`)
*   **Gin Pros:**
    *   **Performance:** Lightweight and high-performance.
    *   **Simplicity:** Relatively simple API, essential features for RESTful APIs.
    *   **Maintainability:** Well-documented, large and active community.
*   **Gin Cons:**
    *   **Dependency:** Adds an external dependency to the project.

*   **Standard Library Pros:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Minimizes dependencies, maximum control over the codebase.
*   **Standard Library Cons:**
    *   **More Boilerplate:** Requires implementing routing and middleware manually.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   *Echo:*
        *   Pros: Good performance and features.
        *   Cons: Slightly more complex than Gin.
    *   *Revel:*
        *   Pros: Full-stack framework, many features out of the box.
        *   Cons: Overkill for `simple-sync`.

## 3. Database: SQLite

*   **Choice:** SQLite
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Lightweight, file-based, no separate server process required, easy to set up and use.
    *   **Performance:** Surprisingly performant for many use cases, especially with smaller data volumes.
    *   **Maintainability:** Well-established and reliable, simple API.
    *   **Local-First:** Aligns well with the local-first philosophy.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Concurrency:** Can struggle with very high write concurrency.
    *   **Scalability:** Limited scalability for extremely large data volumes.

*   **Alternatives Considered:**
    *   *PostgreSQL:*
        *   Pros: Powerful and scalable.
        *   Cons: Adds complexity to setup and deployment.
    *   *MySQL:*
        *   Pros: Robust and widely used.
        *   Cons: Adds complexity to setup and deployment.
    *   *Flat File (JSON):*
        *   Pros: (None - highly discouraged)
        *   Cons: Poor scalability, data integrity issues, not recommended.

## 4. Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

*   **Choice:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Stateless:** Server doesn't need to store session information, simplifies scaling.
    *   **Standardized:** Widely adopted standard, excellent library support.
    *   **Security:** Secure when used correctly (strong secret key, proper validation).
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Complexity:** Requires understanding JWT concepts and proper implementation.
    *   **Token Size:** Can be larger than simple tokens.
    *   **Secret Key Management:** Requires secure storage and management of the secret key.

## 5. Configuration: TOML

*   **Choice:** TOML
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Simplicity:** Human-readable, easy to write and parse.
    *   **Go Support:** Excellent TOML parsing libraries available in Go.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Limited Features:** Not as feature-rich as other configuration formats like YAML or JSON.
