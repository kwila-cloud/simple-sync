## Events

Data is represented as a sequence of events.

Each event has the following schema of 6 fields, represented as a JSON object.

```json
{
  "uuid": "string",
  "timestamp": "uint64",
  "userUuid": "string",
  "itemUuid": "string",
  "action": "string",
  "payload": "string"
}
```

All data querying is handled locally. This means that `simple-sync` is inappropriate for situations that require large numbers of items. It is much better suited for systems that need to store a small amount of items that don't change too frequently.

## Syncing Process

The syncing process ensures that all clients have the latest version of the event history. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Authoritative History:** The server maintains the authoritative history of all events. This is the single source of truth for the data.
2.  **Initial Sync:** When a new client comes online, it performs an initial sync by retrieving the entire authoritative history from the server via the [API](/api/v1).
3.  **Local Diff History:** After the initial sync, the client keeps a local history (the "diff history") of any events generated by the user on that client. These events are stored locally and represent changes that have not yet been synchronized with the server.
4.  **Periodic Push:** The client periodically pushes its local diff history to the server via the [API](/api/v1). This is typically triggered by the user (e.g., with a "sync" button) to avoid conflicts during active use.
5.  **Server-Side Merge:** The server receives the diff history from the client and merges it into the authoritative history, applying any necessary conflict resolution or validation logic. The server will also ensure that all events follow the rules defined in the [ACL Specification](/acl).
6.  **New Authoritative History:** The server responds to the client's push request with the updated authoritative history.
7.  **Client Update:** The client replaces its local copy of the authoritative history with the new version received from the server and clears its local diff history.

This process ensures that all clients eventually converge on the same state, while also allowing for offline work and local data access.
