title: Internal Events
description: Documentation for internal events used in Simple Sync for special functionality and audit trails.
---

Any event that uses a `.` prefix for the item or action is **reserved** for internal usage.

Internal events are used in two ways.

First, to allow users to trigger special functionality within the server. These events are marked **Trigger: User** below.

Second, to allow the server to create an audit history for all actions triggered through the API. These events are marked **Trigger: API** below. These events will **always** be rejected if users attempt to add them.

## ACL

**Trigger: API**

The `.acl` item is used for updating the [ACL](/simple-sync/acl). ACL events are created automatically by the server when users submit ACL rules via the dedicated `POST /api/v1/acl` endpoint. The payload contains a valid ACL rule with `user`, `item`, and `action` fields. The event's `action` is always `.acl.allow` (deny rules are not currently supported). These events are timestamped with the current server time to prevent historical rule injection.

## Users

The `.user.` item prefix is used for events related to user administration and authentication.

### Create User

**Trigger: User**

The `.user.create` action is used for creating new users. The new user's ID is given in the event's `item` field (for example `"item": ".user.bob"`). If the given user ID already exists, the event is rejected.

### Generate User Token

**Trigger: API**

The `.user.generateToken` action is used to log calls to the `/api/v1/user/generateToken` API endpoint. 

### Exchange User Token

**Trigger: API**

The `.user.exchangeToken` action is used to log calls to the `/api/v1/user/exchangeToken` API endpoint. 

### Reset User Key

**Trigger: API**

The `.user.resetKey` action is used to log calls to the `/api/v1/user/resetKey` API endpoint.
