# Research Findings: High Performance REST API for simple-sync

## Go 1.25 Best Practices for REST APIs with Gin
- **Decision**: Use Gin router with middleware pattern for authentication and CORS
- **Rationale**: Gin provides excellent performance and clean API for REST endpoints, middleware allows modular auth/ACL handling, leveraging Go 1.25 improvements
- **Alternatives considered**: Standard net/http (too verbose), Echo (similar but Gin has better community)

## JWT Implementation Patterns in Go
- **Decision**: Use golang-jwt library with HMAC signing, 24-hour expiration
- **Rationale**: Stateless authentication fits REST principles, HMAC provides good security for MVP
- **Alternatives considered**: Custom token system (complex), OAuth (overkill for MVP)

## File-Based JSON Storage Patterns for Concurrent Access
- **Decision**: Use atomic file writes with temporary files, RWMutex for in-memory cache
- **Rationale**: Ensures data integrity during concurrent writes, JSON keeps it human-readable
- **Alternatives considered**: Direct file writes (risk of corruption), database (adds complexity)

## ACL Implementation Patterns
- **Decision**: In-memory ACL with deny-by-default, wildcard support for flexible permissions
- **Rationale**: Simple evaluation logic, supports the required user/item/action model
- **Alternatives considered**: Database-backed ACL (unnecessary complexity), hardcoded permissions (not flexible)

## Docker Deployment Patterns
- **Decision**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with Alpine runtime, docker-compose for easy setup
- **Rationale**: Minimizes image size, docker-compose simplifies development workflow
- **Alternatives considered**: Single-stage Dockerfile (larger images), manual deployment (more complex)

## Testing Patterns for Go APIs
- **Decision**: Contract tests for endpoints, integration tests for user flows, unit tests for business logic
- **Rationale**: TDD approach ensures quality, contract tests validate API compatibility
- **Alternatives considered**: Only integration tests (slower), no contract tests (less reliable)

## Performance Optimization for Go REST APIs
- **Decision**: Use connection pooling, efficient JSON marshaling, goroutines for concurrent requests
- **Rationale**: Leverages Go's strengths in concurrency and performance
- **Alternatives considered**: Synchronous processing (lower throughput), external caching (adds complexity)
