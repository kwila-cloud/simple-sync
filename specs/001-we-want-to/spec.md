# Feature Specification: High Performance REST API for simple-sync

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We want to build a high performance REST API that fulfills the design described in README.md, docs/tech-stack.md, docs/api.md, and docs/acl.md. The REST API is meant to be a flexible backend that can be used for many different frontend-apps. It must be very simple to run with docker compose, so that users can spin up a new instance of simple-sync for each new web app they want to implement."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer building frontend applications, I want to easily deploy a high-performance REST API backend using docker compose, so that I can synchronize data across multiple frontend apps with event storage and access control.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a docker-compose.yml file is configured, **When** I run `docker-compose up`, **Then** the simple-sync API starts successfully and is accessible on the specified port.
2. **Given** the API is running, **When** I authenticate a user and perform event operations, **Then** the system stores events and enforces ACL permissions correctly.
3. **Given** multiple frontend apps are connected, **When** they push and pull events, **Then** the system maintains data consistency and handles concurrent access.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the system receives a high volume of concurrent requests?
- How does the system handle invalid JWT tokens or unauthorized access attempts?
- What occurs if the SQLite database becomes corrupted or unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide REST API endpoints for managing events, including GET and POST /events as specified in docs/api.md
- **FR-002**: System MUST implement ACL-based access control for users and items, supporting rules with wildcards as described in docs/acl.md
- **FR-003**: System MUST support JWT authentication for user login and token validation
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist event data and ACL configurations to SQLite database for data survival across restarts
- **FR-005**: System MUST be deployable via docker compose with minimal configuration for easy setup by developers
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle high-performance scenarios with efficient data querying and storage operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide admin endpoints for user management as outlined in docs/api.md

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Event**: Represents a timestamped action performed by a user on an item, with fields for uuid, timestamp, userUuid, itemUuid, action, and payload
- **User**: An authenticated entity with a unique UUID, username, and password for access control
- **ACL Entry**: Defines permissions for a user on specific items and actions, supporting wildcard patterns
