# Feature Specification: 007-acl-endpoint

**Feature Branch**: `007-acl-endpoint`  
**Created**: Fri Oct 03 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Add a dedicated API endpoint specifically for submitting ACL events to ensure they are always created with the current timestamp. Modify the existing /events endpoint to reject any ACL events submitted through it. Update the ACL documentation, internal events documentation, and API documentation to reflect these changes."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

- Q: What user roles are authorized to submit ACL events via the dedicated endpoint? ‚Üí A: Users with specific ACL permissions
- Q: What are the required attributes for an ACL Event entity? ‚Üí A: The user, item, and action.
- Q: How should the system handle invalid ACL data submitted to the dedicated endpoint? ‚Üí A: Reject with 400 error
- Q: What authentication mechanism is required for the dedicated endpoint? ‚Üí A: API key only
- Q: How should concurrent submissions to the dedicated endpoint be handled? ‚Üí A: Queue and process

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user with specific ACL permissions, I want to add ACL rules through a dedicated endpoint so that I can ensure rules are timestamped correctly and prevent outdated rules from being submitted.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have specific ACL permissions, **When** I submit an ACL event via the dedicated endpoint, **Then** it should be accepted and stored with the current timestamp.
2. **Given** I attempt to submit an ACL event via the /events endpoint, **Then** it should be rejected with an appropriate error.

### Edge Cases
- Invalid ACL data is rejected with a 400 error.
- Concurrent submissions are queued and processed sequentially.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a dedicated API endpoint for submitting ACL events
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically set the current timestamp on ACL events submitted via the dedicated endpoint
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject ACL events submitted via the /events endpoint
- **FR-004**: System MUST update ACL documentation to describe the new endpoint
- **FR-005**: System MUST update internal events documentation
- **FR-006**: System MUST update API documentation
- **FR-007**: System MUST authorize only users with specific ACL permissions to access the dedicated ACL endpoint
- **FR-008**: System MUST require API key authentication for the dedicated ACL endpoint

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ACL Event**: Represents an access control rule with required attributes: user, item, action (timestamp set automatically)
