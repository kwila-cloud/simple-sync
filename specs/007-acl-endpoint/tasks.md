# Tasks: 007-acl-endpoint

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/007-acl-endpoint/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Verify Go project structure and dependencies
- [ ] T002 [P] Configure Go linting and formatting tools

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T003 [P] Contract test for POST /api/v1/acl in tests/contract/acl_post_test.go
- [ ] T004 [P] Integration test for ACL event submission in tests/integration/acl_submission_test.go
- [ ] T005 [P] Integration test for ACL rejection via /events in tests/integration/acl_rejection_test.go
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test for invalid ACL data handling in tests/integration/acl_validation_test.go

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T007 [P] ACL Event model validation in models/acl.go
- [ ] T008 ACL handler for POST /api/v1/acl in handlers/acl.go
- [ ] T009 Modify POST /api/v1/events handler to reject ACL events in handlers/handlers.go

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T010 Integrate ACL storage with existing event storage in storage/interface.go and storage/memory.go
- [ ] T011 Apply authentication middleware to ACL endpoint in main.go

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T012 [P] Unit tests for ACL validation in tests/unit/acl_validation_test.go
- [ ] T013 [P] Update ACL documentation in docs/src/content/docs/acl.mdx
- [ ] T014 [P] Update internal events documentation in docs/src/content/docs/internal-events.mdx
- [ ] T015 [P] Update API documentation in docs/src/content/docs/api/v1.md
- [ ] T016 Run quickstart validation tests

## Dependencies
- Tests (T003-T006) before implementation (T007-T011)
- T007 blocks T008, T010
- T008 blocks T011
- Implementation before polish (T012-T016)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T003-T006 together:
Task: "Contract test for POST /api/v1/acl in tests/contract/acl_post_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for ACL event submission in tests/integration/acl_submission_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for ACL rejection via /events in tests/integration/acl_rejection_test.go"
Task: "Integration test for invalid ACL data handling in tests/integration/acl_validation_test.go"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task</content>
