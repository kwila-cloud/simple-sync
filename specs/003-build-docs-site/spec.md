# Feature Specification: Build a docs site to replace our docs directory

**Feature Branch**: `003-build-docs-site`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a docs site to replace our docs directory."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or user of the simple-sync project, I want to access the documentation through a user-friendly web site instead of navigating raw markdown files in the docs directory, so that I can easily browse and read the documentation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the docs directory contains markdown files, **When** I build the docs site, **Then** I can access a web page with navigation and rendered content.
2. **Given** the docs site is built, **When** I click on a documentation section, **Then** I see the content properly formatted.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the docs directory is empty?
- How does the system handle broken links or missing files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate a static web site from markdown files in the docs directory.
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide navigation between documentation pages.
- **FR-003**: System MUST render markdown content properly (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.).
- **FR-004**: System MUST be accessible via a web browser.
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve the structure of the docs directory in the site navigation.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Documentation Page**: Represents a markdown file with title, content, and path.
- **Site Navigation**: Hierarchical structure based on directory organization.
