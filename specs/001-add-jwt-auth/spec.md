# Feature Specification: Add JWT Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-jwt-auth`  
**Created**: Sat Sep 20 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement JWT-based authentication system with token generation and validation middleware to secure the events endpoints, according to issue #4 and the design in docs/api.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the simple-sync system, I need to authenticate myself securely so that I can access and modify event data while ensuring that unauthorized users cannot access the system.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has valid credentials, **When** they request a token via POST /auth/token, **Then** they receive a valid JWT token that allows access to protected endpoints
2. **Given** a user has a valid JWT token, **When** they access GET /events or POST /events, **Then** the request succeeds and returns the expected data
3. **Given** a user has an invalid or expired JWT token, **When** they access protected endpoints, **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response
4. **Given** a user attempts to access protected endpoints without any token, **When** they make the request, **Then** they receive a 401 Unauthorized response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user provides incorrect username/password to /auth/token?
- How does the system handle JWT tokens that have expired?
- What happens if a user tries to access admin endpoints without admin privileges?
- How does the system behave when the JWT secret is not configured?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a token generation endpoint that accepts username and password and returns a valid JWT token
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate JWT tokens on all protected endpoints and allow access only with valid tokens
- **FR-003**: System MUST reject requests to protected endpoints when no token is provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject requests to protected endpoints when an invalid or expired token is provided
- **FR-005**: System MUST extract user information from valid JWT tokens and make it available to endpoint handlers
- **FR-006**: System MUST support configurable JWT secret for token signing and validation
- **FR-007**: System MUST set appropriate expiration time on generated JWT tokens
- **FR-008**: System MUST return proper error responses (401 Unauthorized) for authentication failures
- **FR-009**: System MUST support Bearer token format in Authorization header for protected requests
- **FR-010**: System MUST protect all /events endpoints with authentication middleware

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Represents an authenticated user with username and password credentials
- **JWT Token**: Represents an authentication token containing user information and expiration
- **Authentication Request**: Represents a request to generate a token with username/password
- **Protected Endpoint**: Represents API endpoints that require valid authentication
