# Implementation Plan: Add JWT Authentication

**Branch**: `001-add-jwt-auth` | **Date**: Sat Sep 20 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/home/aemig/Documents/repos/kwila/simple-sync/specs/001-add-jwt-auth/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement JWT-based authentication system to secure the simple-sync API endpoints. The system will provide token generation via POST /auth/token endpoint, JWT middleware for request validation, and integration with the existing ACL system for fine-grained access control. All /events endpoints will be protected while maintaining the event-driven architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.25
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin web framework, golang-jwt/jwt/v5
**Storage**: SQLite database (existing)
**Testing**: Contract tests (existing), unit tests
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Single project (Go backend API)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms response time for auth endpoints
**Constraints**: Must integrate with existing event-driven architecture, ACL system
**Scale/Scope**: MVP with hardcoded users, extensible to user management

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ RESTful API Design: POST /auth/token endpoint follows REST principles with JSON request/response
- ✅ Event-Driven Architecture: Authentication integrates with existing event system without changing data model
- ✅ Authentication and Authorization: JWT auth system with ACL integration planned
- ✅ Data Persistence: Uses existing SQLite database for any auth-related data
- ✅ Security and Access Control: JWT middleware + ACL rules with deny-by-default behavior

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single Go project (backend API only)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each API endpoint from contracts → contract test task [P]
- Each entity from data-model.md → model creation task [P]
- Each user scenario from quickstart.md → integration test task
- JWT middleware implementation task
- Authentication endpoint implementation task
- Integration tasks for existing event endpoints
- Configuration tasks for JWT secret and user setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests first, then implementation to make tests pass
- Dependency order: Models → Auth service → Middleware → Endpoint integration
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files like separate model files)
- Sequential for integration tasks that depend on multiple components

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- JWT library setup and configuration
- User and token data models
- Authentication service implementation
- JWT middleware creation
- POST /auth/token endpoint
- Integration with existing /events endpoints
- Contract and integration tests
- Documentation updates

**Task Categories**:
1. **Setup Tasks**: JWT dependency, configuration
2. **Model Tasks**: User, Token entities
3. **Service Tasks**: Auth service, JWT utilities
4. **Middleware Tasks**: Authentication middleware
5. **Endpoint Tasks**: /auth/token implementation
6. **Integration Tasks**: Protect existing endpoints
7. **Testing Tasks**: Contract tests, integration tests
8. **Documentation Tasks**: Update API docs

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
