# Feature Specification: Implement ACL System

**Feature Branch**: `005-implement-acl-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement ACL system. We will implement the full ACL system exactly as specified in the docs. We will build appropriate test coverage and avoid breaking any of the current tests."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: What happens when ACL rules contain wildcards (* or prefix.*) and exact matches? → A: Determined by specificity scoring where exact matches have higher specificity
- Q: How are conflicting allow/deny rules resolved when they have the same specificity? → A: The rule with the latest timestamp wins
- Q: What occurs when an ACL event itself violates current ACL permissions? → A: The event is rejected and not stored
- Q: How are timestamp ties resolved in rule evaluation? → A: The last rule encountered wins

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I want to define and enforce access control rules for users performing actions on items so that I can secure the system and prevent unauthorized operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with no ACL permissions for an action on an item, **When** they attempt to submit an event for that action, **Then** the event should be rejected and not added to the history.
2. **Given** an ACL rule allowing a user to perform a specific action on an item, **When** they submit an event for that action, **Then** the event should be accepted and added to the history.
3. **Given** multiple ACL rules with different specificity, **When** evaluating permissions, **Then** the rule with highest specificity should determine the outcome.
4. **Given** the .root user, **When** they perform any action, **Then** ACL checks should be bypassed.

### Edge Cases
- Exact matches take precedence over wildcards based on specificity scoring.
- For conflicting allow/deny rules at the same specificity, the rule with the latest timestamp wins.
- ACL events that violate current permissions are rejected and not stored.
- In case of timestamp ties, the last rule encountered wins.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow all users to view all events (read-only access).
- **FR-002**: System MUST deny all actions by default unless explicitly allowed by ACL rules.
- **FR-003**: System MUST support ACL rules with user, item, and action fields supporting exact values, wildcards (*), and prefix wildcards (e.g., task.*).
- **FR-004**: System MUST evaluate ACL rules based on specificity scoring (item > user > action > timestamp).
- **FR-005**: System MUST store ACL rules as events on the .acl item with .acl.allow or .acl.deny actions. ACL rules can be retrieved by querying events with itemUuid=.acl.
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate ACL events against current ACL before adding to history.
- **FR-007**: System MUST bypass ACL checks for the .root user.
- **FR-008**: System MUST filter out events violating ACL during POST /api/v1/events.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide comprehensive test coverage for ACL logic without breaking existing tests.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ACL Rule**: Represents a permission rule with user, item, action fields and allow/deny type.
- **Event**: Core data structure containing ACL rules when item is .acl.
