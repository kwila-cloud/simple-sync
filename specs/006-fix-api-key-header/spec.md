# Feature Specification: Fix API Key Header

**Feature Branch**: `006-fix-api-key-header`  
**Created**: Fri Oct 03 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Use the "X-API-Key:" header rather than "Authorization: Bearer " header for the API key."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (API clients), actions (authentication), data (API key), constraints (header format)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: Should the system continue to support the Authorization: Bearer header, or completely replace it with X-API-Key? ‚Üí A: Completely replace - reject Authorization: Bearer and only accept X-API-Key

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer integrating with the simple-sync API, I want to use the standard X-API-Key header for authentication so that my requests are more conventional and compatible with common API clients.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid API key, **When** a client sends an API request with the X-API-Key header containing the valid key, **Then** the request should be authenticated successfully and processed.
2. **Given** an invalid API key, **When** a client sends an API request with the X-API-Key header containing an invalid key, **Then** the request should be rejected with an authentication error.
3. **Given** a valid API key, **When** a client sends an API request with the Authorization: Bearer header containing the valid key, **Then** the request should be rejected with an authentication error.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when both X-API-Key and Authorization: Bearer headers are provided in the same request? ‚Üí Reject the request with an authentication error
- How does the system handle requests with neither header? ‚Üí Reject with an authentication error
- What if the X-API-Key header is provided but empty? ‚Üí Reject with an authentication error

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept and authenticate requests using the X-API-Key header containing a valid API key
- **FR-002**: System MUST reject requests with invalid API keys in the X-API-Key header
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide clear error responses for authentication failures
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject requests using the Authorization: Bearer header

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Key**: Represents user authentication credentials, used to authorize API requests
