# Feature Specification: Update Auth System

**Feature Branch**: `004-update-auth-system`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the new feature spec will be in 004-update-auth-system. The new feature should follow all the requirements given in issue #35."
**Note**: No existing users - no migration or backwards compatibility concerns.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the simple-sync system, I want to authenticate using long-lived API keys instead of passwords and expiring tokens, so that I can have simpler authentication management and better offline support.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user is created, **When** the user account exists, **Then** it has no API key or setup token until explicitly reset.
2. **Given** a user needs initial access, **When** an authorized user calls generateToken or resetKey, **Then** the system generates a setup token for that user.
3. **Given** a user has a setup token, **When** they exchange it for an API key without additional authorization, **Then** they receive a long-lived API key for ongoing authentication.
4. **Given** a user has an API key, **When** they make API requests, **Then** the system authenticates them without requiring password management or token refresh.
5. **Given** a user has multiple API keys, **When** they use any valid key for authentication, **Then** the system authenticates them successfully.
6. **Given** a user needs to reset their access, **When** an authorized user calls generateToken or resetKey, **Then** the system generates a new setup token for that user.
7. **Given** a user attempts to exchange an invalid setup token, **When** they call the exchange endpoint, **Then** the system returns an auth error.
8. **Given** a user attempts operations on a non-existent user, **When** they call resetKey, **Then** the system returns an auth error (preventing user enumeration).
9. **Given** a user attempts to exchange a token for a non-existent user, **When** they call token exchange, **Then** the system returns an auth error (preventing user enumeration).

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a setup token expires before use? (Return auth error)
- How does the system handle attempts to create multiple setup tokens for the same user? (Invalidate previous, allow only one valid at a time)
- What happens when an API key is compromised and needs immediate revocation?
- What happens when a user without proper ACL permissions tries to reset another user's key? (Return auth error)
- How should the system handle resetKey calls for non-existent users? (Return auth error)
- How should the system handle setup token exchange attempts for non-existent users? (Return auth error)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST NOT generate API keys or setup tokens automatically for new users
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide resetKey endpoint that generates setup tokens when called
- **FR-003**: System MUST restrict resetKey endpoint to users with `.user.resetKey` ACL permission for the target user ID
- **FR-004**: System MUST restrict generateToken endpoint to users with `.user.generateToken` ACL permission for the target user ID
- **FR-005**: System MUST authenticate exchangeToken requests using the setup token itself
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow `.root` user unrestricted access to all user management endpoints
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow exchange of setup tokens for API keys
- **FR-008**: System MUST support multiple API keys per user for simultaneous client authentication
- **FR-009**: System MUST authenticate users using API keys instead of passwords
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain user identity resolution from API keys
- **FR-011**: System MUST ensure setup tokens expire after 24 hours
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce single-use constraint on setup tokens
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow only one valid setup token per user at a time
- **FR-014**: System MUST return auth error for invalid setup token exchanges
- **FR-015**: System MUST return auth error for all operations on non-existent users (preventing user enumeration)
- **FR-016**: System MUST eliminate password management complexity

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **API Key**: Cryptographically random credential with sk_ prefix for user authentication, never expires, stored separately from event data
- **Setup Token**: 8-character alphanumeric token with hyphen separator (XXXX-XXXX format) for initial user setup, short-lived and single-use, expires after 24 hours
- **User**: System user with associated API key for authentication and authorization
