# Implementation Plan: Docker Configuration for Easy Deployment

**Branch**: `002-implement-issue-1` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: /home/aemig/Documents/repos/kwila/simple-sync/specs/002-implement-issue-1/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-implement-issue-1/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implement Docker containerization for the simple-sync service to enable easy deployment and development. This includes creating Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, environment configuration, and documentation for running the service in containers.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.21+
**Primary Dependencies**: Gin web framework, SQLite, JWT authentication
**Storage**: SQLite database (already implemented)
**Testing**: Go testing framework with testify
**Target Platform**: Linux containers (Docker)
**Project Type**: Single web service (Go backend API)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms response times for API endpoints
**Constraints**: Must maintain existing functionality, JWT_SECRET required, configurable port
**Scale/Scope**: Single container deployment, supports environment-based configuration

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- RESTful API Design: All planned endpoints MUST use appropriate HTTP methods and follow resource-oriented patterns.
- Event-Driven Architecture: Data model MUST be based on timestamped events with user/item metadata.
- Authentication and Authorization: JWT auth and ACL permissions MUST be integrated into the design.
- Data Persistence: SQLite database MUST be used for data survival.
- Security and Access Control: ACL rules MUST be evaluated with deny-by-default behavior.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 - Single project structure since this is a backend API service with no frontend components.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Docker best practices for Go applications
   - Multi-stage build optimization for Go binaries
   - Environment variable handling in Docker
   - Docker Compose configuration patterns
   - Health check endpoints for container orchestration

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research Docker containerization for Go web services"
     Task: "Research multi-stage Docker builds for Go applications"
     Task: "Research Docker Compose patterns for development environments"
     Task: "Research health check endpoints for containerized services"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Docker configuration entities (containers, networks, volumes)
   - Environment variables and their validation
   - Health check response format

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Health check endpoint contract (if needed)
   - Existing API contracts remain unchanged

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Health check endpoint tests (if applicable)
   - Existing contract tests remain functional

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Docker container startup scenario
   - Environment variable configuration scenario
   - Health check validation scenario

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh opencode` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Docker configuration tasks: Dockerfile creation, docker-compose.yml setup
- Environment configuration tasks: .env file handling, variable validation
- Documentation tasks: README updates, deployment instructions
- Testing tasks: Docker container tests, health check validation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Infrastructure first: Docker files before documentation
- Testing integration: Docker setup before container tests
- Documentation last: Implementation complete before docs

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| None identified | N/A | N/A |

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
