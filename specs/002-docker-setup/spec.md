# Feature Specification: Docker Configuration for Easy Deployment

**Feature Branch**: `002-docker-setup`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "implement issue #1 according to the issue description"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer or system administrator, I want to easily deploy and run the simple-sync service in a containerized environment so that I can quickly set up development environments and production deployments without worrying about system dependencies or configuration complexity.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has Docker installed on their system, **When** they run `docker-compose up` in the project directory, **Then** the simple-sync service starts successfully and is accessible on localhost:8080
2. **Given** the service is running in Docker, **When** a user makes a health check request, **Then** the service responds indicating it is healthy and operational
3. **Given** a developer needs to configure the service, **When** they set environment variables like JWT_SECRET and PORT, **Then** the service uses those configurations correctly
4. **Given** the service is running in Docker, **When** a user attempts to access protected endpoints, **Then** authentication works as expected with JWT tokens

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required environment variables are not provided?
- How does the system handle port conflicts on the host machine?
- What happens when the Docker build fails due to missing dependencies?
- How does the system behave when container resources are constrained?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide containerized deployment that allows users to run the service with a single command
- **FR-002**: System MUST be accessible on localhost:8080 after successful container startup
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept JWT_SECRET as an environment variable for authentication configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept PORT as an environment variable to configure the service port
- **FR-005**: System MUST respond to health check requests when running in containers
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality (authentication, event storage) when running in containers
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear documentation for users to understand how to deploy using containers
- **TR-001**: Docker image MUST be built using Go 1.25 for the build stage
