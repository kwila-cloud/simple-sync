# Docker Configuration Research

## Docker Best Practices for Go Applications

**Decision**: Use multi-stage Docker builds with Alpine Linux runtime image
**Rationale**: Multi-stage builds reduce final image size by separating build and runtime environments. Alpine Linux provides a minimal, secure base image that's well-suited for Go applications. This follows Docker best practices for Go services.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single-stage build with Ubuntu - rejected due to larger image size (~500MB vs ~20MB)
- Scratch base image - rejected due to missing shell for debugging and health checks
- Distroless images - considered but Alpine provides better debugging capabilities

## Multi-Stage Build Optimization for Go

**Decision**: Use Go 1.25 builder image and copy only the binary to runtime
**Rationale**: Go binaries are statically linked and don't require Go runtime in the final image. This creates minimal images while maintaining full functionality. The build stage can use CGO if needed for SQLite dependencies.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Single-stage with Go installed in runtime - rejected due to unnecessary bloat
- Cross-compilation outside Docker - rejected as it complicates the build process

## Environment Variable Handling in Docker

**Decision**: Use Docker environment variables with sensible defaults for development
**Rationale**: Environment variables provide flexibility for different deployment environments. JWT_SECRET should be required (no default) for security, while PORT can default to 8080. This follows twelve-factor app principles.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Configuration files - rejected due to container immutability principles
- Build-time arguments only - rejected due to need for runtime configuration

## Docker Compose Patterns for Development

**Decision**: Single service docker-compose.yml with volume mounts for development
**Rationale**: Volume mounts allow hot-reloading during development while maintaining container isolation. Single service keeps configuration simple. Includes restart policies and proper networking.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Multi-service setup with separate database - rejected as SQLite is file-based and doesn't need separate container
- No volumes - rejected as it prevents development workflow

## Health Check Endpoints for Containerized Services

**Decision**: Implement simple HTTP health check endpoint at /health
**Rationale**: Container orchestrators (Docker, Kubernetes) need health checks to monitor service status. A simple HTTP endpoint is lightweight and follows REST conventions. Returns 200 OK when service is healthy.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Database connectivity checks - rejected as overkill for simple health status
- No health checks - rejected as containers need monitoring capabilities
- Complex health checks - rejected to keep implementation simple

## Security Considerations

**Decision**: Run as non-root user in container
**Rationale**: Following principle of least privilege, containers should not run as root. Go binaries can be executed by non-privileged users without issues.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Root execution - rejected due to security best practices
- Complex user management - rejected to keep Dockerfile simple

## Build Context Optimization

**Decision**: Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
**Rationale**: Reduces build context size and prevents sensitive files from being included in images. Should exclude tests, documentation, and development files.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No .dockerignore - rejected as it includes unnecessary files in build context
- Minimal exclusions - rejected as it may include sensitive data

## Summary

The Docker configuration will follow these principles:
- Multi-stage builds for minimal image size
- Environment-based configuration
- Health checks for monitoring
- Security best practices (non-root user)
- Development-friendly with volume mounts
- Clean build context with .dockerignore
