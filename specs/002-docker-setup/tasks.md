# Tasks: Docker Configuration for Easy Deployment

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-docker-setup/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 3.1: Setup
- [ ] T001 Create .dockerignore file to optimize build context
- [ ] T002 Create Dockerfile with multi-stage build (Go builder + Alpine runtime)
- [ ] T003 Create docker-compose.yml for local development and deployment
- [ ] T004 Update .github/workflows/release.yml to build and push Docker images to GHCR on releases

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**
- [ ] T005 [P] Contract test GET /health in tests/contract/test_health_get.go
- [ ] T006 [P] Integration test Docker container startup in tests/integration/test_docker_startup.go
- [ ] T007 [P] Integration test health check endpoint in tests/integration/test_health_check.go
- [ ] T008 [P] Integration test environment variable configuration in tests/integration/test_env_config.go
- [ ] T009 [P] Integration test API authentication in Docker in tests/integration/test_docker_auth.go

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)
- [ ] T010 [P] HealthCheckResponse model in src/models/health.go
- [ ] T011 [P] DockerContainer configuration model in src/models/docker.go
- [ ] T012 [P] EnvironmentConfiguration model in src/models/environment.go
- [ ] T013 GET /health endpoint handler in src/handlers/health.go
- [ ] T014 Update main.go to include health endpoint and environment validation
- [ ] T015 Add health check endpoint to existing handlers/events.go

## Phase 3.4: Integration
- [ ] T016 Configure environment variable validation in main.go
- [ ] T017 Add version information to health response
- [ ] T018 Add uptime tracking to health response
- [ ] T019 Configure Docker health checks in docker-compose.yml

## Phase 3.5: Polish
- [ ] T019 [P] Unit tests for health response model in tests/unit/test_health_model.go
- [ ] T020 [P] Unit tests for environment configuration in tests/unit/test_env_config.go
- [ ] T021 Performance tests for health endpoint (<10ms response)
- [ ] T022 [P] Update README.md with Docker deployment instructions
- [ ] T023 [P] Update docs/api.md with health endpoint documentation
- [ ] T024 Validate docker-compose up works and service is accessible
- [ ] T025 Run manual testing from quickstart.md

## Dependencies
- Tests (T004-T008) before implementation (T009-T018)
- T009-T011 can run in parallel (different model files)
- T012-T014 depend on models being created
- T015-T018 depend on core implementation
- Implementation before polish (T019-T025)

## Parallel Example
```
# Launch T004-T008 together (all test files are different):
Task: "Contract test GET /health in tests/contract/test_health_get.go"
Task: "Integration test Docker container startup in tests/integration/test_docker_startup.go"
Task: "Integration test health check endpoint in tests/integration/test_health_check.go"
Task: "Integration test environment variable configuration in tests/integration/test_env_config.go"
Task: "Integration test API authentication in Docker in tests/integration/test_docker_auth.go"
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file → contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint → implementation task

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity → model creation task [P]
   - Relationships → service layer tasks

3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story → integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios → validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [ ] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [ ] All entities have model tasks
- [ ] All tests come before implementation
- [ ] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [ ] Each task specifies exact file path
- [ ] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
